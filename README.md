# Rapid

Seventh web project in Instant's Diploma using HTML, CSS, JS and bootstrap.

## Overview

In this project I re-designed [Rapid](https://mohamed-elhossin.github.io/task-bootstrap/) Template available on Bootstrap website as part of Instant's Diploma by our instructor [Mohamed-Elhossin](https://github.com/mohamed-Elhossin).

The website must be:

- Responsive.
- Readable on different screen sizes.
